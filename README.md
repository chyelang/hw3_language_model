We provide the start code for this homework.
You need to modify ``model.py`` and ``main.py`` to construct and train your model.
For ``model.py``, we have provided the definition of encoder and decoder. You need to add your RNN model codes.
For ``main.py``, we have provided the dataloader to pre-process text data into tokens. You can use the ``data_loader.get_batch()`` to get a mini-batch of data. Before using the loader, you need to set the ``train`` and ``valid`` flags. Details are in ``data.py``.
You need to write model building code, the evaluation function and train function in ``main.py``.
